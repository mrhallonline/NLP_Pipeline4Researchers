    "Running the code cell below will result in us pulling the following token types for each of our seven corpora.\n",
    "1. word tokens - formed from decomposing sentences into their constituent pieces.\n",
    "2. NLTK text objects - The NLTK library has a unique tokenizer that adds additional metadata to the word token which allows for unique analysis as compared to normal word tokens.\n",
    "3. original sentence tokens - based on numerous features, but normally bounded by punctuation marks. This is why we normally tokenize this first before other text processing.\n",
    "4. normalized sentence tokens - original sentence tokens that have been lowercased, and had stop words, punctuations, and special chracters removed.\n",

    "You can always figure out what type of data corpus you are dealing with by running these print checks. It is also extremely important to also note the importance of keeping your documents categorized, lest they get out of control. The more processing and feature extractions you do, the more you may end up with more different buckets of data to keep up with.\n",

    "Lexical diversity quantifies the variety of unique words found in a document. It produces a numerical measure that indicates how diverse the vocabulary is that is used in a text. Broadly speaking, scores of (0.8 - 1) are considered extremely high and difficult to maintain in typical communicative texts. Scores of 0.4-0.79 are considered moderate to high; most high-quality texts fall in this range. Scores of (0 - 0.39) are considered low lexical diversity and tend to suggest highly specialized or technical language usage (e.g., instruction manuals) or language aimed at young readers. This measure is sensitive to corpus length (longer corpora have more opportunities to repeat words), but comparing lexical diversity scores can allow for quantitative comparison that might suggest potential changes in how the usage of language may differ between groups."
